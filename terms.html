        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
            <p>RobloxLink is a Discord bot service that provides account verification functionality between Roblox and Discord platforms. The service allows Discord server administrators to verify member accounts through secure Roblox OAuth authentication and automatically assign roles based on Roblox group membership and rank requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Authorized Usage</h3>
            <ul>

            <h2>3. Verification Process and Role Management</h2>
            
            <h3>3.1 Account Verification</h3>
            <p>Users verify their identity through Roblox's official OAuth system. This process securely links your Discord account to your Roblox account without sharing sensitive credentials. Verification data is stored securely and used solely for role assignment purposes.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Role Assignment</h3>
            <p>Discord roles are automatically assigned based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Roblox group membership status</li>
                <li>Current group rank within specified Roblox groups</li>
                <li>Role binding configurations set by server administrators</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3.3 Data Accuracy</h3>
            <p>Role assignments reflect your Roblox account status at the time of verification or when manually updated. We are not responsible for discrepancies caused by changes in your Roblox group status between verification sessions.</p>
